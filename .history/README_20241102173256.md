# Quantum Computing Solutions for Bin Packing Problem

## Introduction

### Problem Statement
The Bin Packing Problem (BPP) is a classic optimization challenge where items of different weights must be packed into a minimum number of fixed-capacity bins. This implementation explores various quantum computing approaches to solve BPP.

## Implementation Overview

### 1. Problem Formulation
- Started with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation
- Transformed ILP to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
- Created test instances of varying sizes:
  - Small (6 qubits)
  - Medium (20 qubits)
  - Large (>30 qubits)

### 2. Solution Approaches Implemented

#### Classical Approach
- Brute Force solver
  - Guaranteed optimal solution for small instances
  - Execution time: 0.02s (small) â†’ 6,628s (medium)
  - Becomes infeasible for large instances

#### Quantum Approaches

1. **Quantum Annealing**
   - Used D-Wave Ocean Framework
   - Best performing approach
   - Results:
     - Small Instance: -75,000 (4.2s)
     - Medium Instance: -196,000 (4.3s)
     - Successfully handled large instances
   - Consistent execution times across problem sizes

2. **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)**
   - Results:
     - Small Instance: -7,000 (0.48s)
     - Medium Instance: -60,000 (244s)
     - Unable to process large instances
   - Showed significant scaling issues

3. **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**
   - Custom implementation
   - Results:
     - Small Instance: -2,823 (1.72s)
     - Medium Instance: -29,047 (511s)
     - Unable to process large instances
   - Poorest solution quality among quantum approaches

## Performance Analysis
 
 The Brute force method systematically explores entire solution space testing every possible combination which guarantees finding global optimum. However, with increase in number of items the the number of combinations of packing the items into the bins increase exponentially (O(2^n)) and the brute force method becomes infeasible.
 As we move onto the quantum approaches, 



## Key Findings
